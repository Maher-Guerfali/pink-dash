                  TASKPINK APP - FOLLOW-UP Q&A (BEGINNER FRIENDLY)
================================================================================

1) Why use axios (HTTP client)?
   - Simpler syntax than fetch; less boilerplate.
   - Auto JSON handling; fewer manual steps.
   - Central place for headers/baseURL (see fhirService.ts fhirClient).
   - Built-in request/response interceptors (future auth/logging).
   - Better error object (status, data) for debugging.

2) useParams example: const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
   - URL: /patient/abc123
   - React Router matches route pattern: /patient/:id
   - :id is only the dynamic segment AFTER /patient/
   - So id = "abc123" (not the whole /patient/abc123).
   - Analogy: Template "/folder/:file" + URL "/folder/readme" → file = "readme".

3) Unit tests present?
   - No tests are currently implemented in this repo.
   - If asked: "We have not added unit tests yet; next step would be to test services (API calls) and components (rendering + state)."

4) getPatients(limit = 20): why 20?
   - Safety/default to avoid huge downloads from the public API.
   - Limit is configurable: PatientService.getPatients(50) will fetch 50.
   - The UI lets you choose 10/20/30/50; 20 is just the default.

5) What makes useEffect run in PatientDetail?
   - Code: useEffect(() => { if (id) fetchPatient(id); }, [id]);
   - Dependency array [id] means: run once on mount, and again whenever id changes.
   - The route change (navigate to /patient/123) updates id, which triggers the effect, which calls fetchPatient('123').

6) What is a Bundle response?
   - The FHIR server returns a JSON object whose resourceType is "Bundle".
   - Bundle = a wrapper that contains many entries; each entry holds a Patient resource.
   - We map over bundle.entry to extract entry.resource (the actual Patient objects).
   - So yes, it is still JSON; it's just JSON with a FHIR Bundle shape.

7) "Fix: Error handling already in code" — where?
   - fhirService.ts: try/catch with console.error and rethrow.
   - PatientList.tsx: catch sets error state → UI shows message.
   - PatientDetail.tsx: catch sets error state → UI shows message.

8) "How does search work?" Can we index?
   - Current implementation: client-side filter in PatientList.tsx.
     * Takes the already-fetched patients array.
     * Converts name/id/gender to lowercase and checks includes(searchTerm).
   - Indexing idea (not implemented):
     * For big datasets, add server-side search params (e.g., /Patient?name=John).
     * Or build a local index/trie/Map by id/name for faster lookups.

9) Axios vs fetch — how does axios handle errors?
   - Axios rejects the promise for HTTP errors (status outside 2xx).
   - You can read error.response.status and error.response.data.
   - In our code, we catch errors in the service and rethrow; UI components set error state and render a message.

================================================================================
If you want, I can add a short test for PatientService using msw (mock server) or add in-code comments where these behaviors live.
